Real-Time Pollution Monitoring System â€“ Instructions

1. Overview
This system monitors air, water, and soil pollution using sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi. It provides real-time data and alerts via the Blynk IoT platform.

2. Hardware Components Required:
- Raspberry Pi
- MCP3008 ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)
- MQ2 & MQ3 Gas Sensors
- Turbidity Sensor
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Soil Temperature Sensor
- Connecting Wires and Breadboard
- Power Supply

3. Software Requirements:
- Raspberry Pi OS
- Python 3
- Blynk IoT App & Library
- GPIO and SPI Python Libraries

4. System Features

4.1 Air Pollution Monitoring Module
- Sensors: MQ2 & MQ3 (detect smoke, methane, CO).
- Processing: Use MCP3008 ADC to convert analog sensor data; process via Raspberry Pi.
- Monitoring: Upload data to Blynk IoT; trigger alerts when air quality exceeds safe levels.

4.2 Water Pollution Monitoring Module
- Sensor: Turbidity Sensor (measures clarity/contamination).
- Processing: MCP3008 ADC converts readings; Raspberry Pi transmits data.
- Monitoring: Real-time updates on Blynk; alert if water is contaminated.

4.3 Soil Pollution Monitoring Module
- Sensors: Soil moisture and temperature sensors.
- Processing: Readings digitized by MCP3008 and sent to Raspberry Pi.
- Monitoring: Data displayed in Blynk IoT; instant alerts sent to users (e.g., farmers).

5. Steps to Implement:
1. Connect sensors to MCP3008 and then to Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.
2. Configure SPI communication on Raspberry Pi.
3. Install Blynk libraries and set up a Blynk project with virtual pins.
4. Write Python scripts to:
   - Read sensor values via MCP3008
   - Process and analyze data
   - Send data to Blynk app
5. Set threshold levels in code to trigger alerts when pollution levels are unsafe.
6. Run the Python script and monitor data in real time on your smartphone or web dashboard.
